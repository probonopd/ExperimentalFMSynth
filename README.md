# Experimental FM Synthesizer

Experimental frequency modulation (FM) synthesizer to experiment with the ideas expressed in the [John Chowning, Computer Music, DX7 & FM Discovery](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu8lHX-xuSg) video by Anthony Marinelli Music.

> Chowning: FM is two carriers and one modulator. It's my basic unit. And then the complexity is by adding bunches of those. It's the idea of two oscillators, and complexity is by putting a lot of those together. 
> 
> Marinelli: So just one modulator, and then the carriers can be whatever. 
> 
> Chowning: If you have two carriers, you can create resonances, a simulation of resonances like more vocal tones.
> 
> So you have one carrier that modulates the pitch frequency, and the other one is a multiple of the pitch frequency. So if you want a resonance around the seventh harmonic, you make that carrier seven times the pitch with a separate envelope. The modulator is the same for both; the modulator is always the pitch frequency. So that's my basic unit, and complexity then is just multiple (of those).
> 
> Marinelli: Yeah, I mean, I get that because by limiting, you can work with it. It's like starting with an orchestra. It's like, okay, there's a violin, and then I know how to do things to go off the rails and play the violin in all these different parts: col legno, sul tasto, going crazy and creating sidebands with them beating against each other and all that. But there's still a core that you want to come home to as the listener of your own music, too. There's not just the listener out there to follow your own flow. So I like what you're saying. It shows me a lot that you, who can have all this unlimited amount of possibilities, still come home to something and build from there.
