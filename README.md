# Experimental FM Synthesizer

Experimental frequency modulation (FM) synthesizer to experiment with the ideas expressed in the [John Chowning, Computer Music, DX7 & FM Discovery](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu8lHX-xuSg) video by Anthony Marinelli Music.

To some people, frequency modulation as implemented in the DX series of synthesizers (using algorithms) is complex to grasp. When asked, John Chowning, the discoverer of frequency modulation, gave an explanation how he uses it - and it is very different from how it is implemented in the DX series of synthesizers:

> Chowning: FM is two carriers and one modulator. It's my basic unit. And then the complexity is by adding bunches of those. It's the idea of two oscillators, and complexity is by putting a lot of those together. 
> 
> Marinelli: So just one modulator, and then the carriers can be whatever. 
> 
> Chowning: If you have two carriers, you can create resonances, a simulation of resonances like more vocal tones.
> 
> So you have one carrier that modulates the pitch frequency, and the other one is a multiple of the pitch frequency. So if you want a resonance around the seventh harmonic, you make that carrier seven times the pitch with a separate envelope. The modulator is the same for both; the modulator is always the pitch frequency. So that's my basic unit, and complexity then is just multiple (of those).
> 
> Marinelli: Yeah, I mean, I get that because by limiting, you can work with it. It's like starting with an orchestra. It's like, okay, there's a violin, and then I know how to do things to go off the rails and play the violin in all these different parts: col legno, sul tasto, going crazy and creating sidebands with them beating against each other and all that. But there's still a core that you want to come home to as the listener of your own music, too. There's not just the listener out there to follow your own flow. So I like what you're saying. It shows me a lot that you, who can have all this unlimited amount of possibilities, still come home to something and build from there.

So, multiple "units" containing two carriers and one modulator each. This is how John Chowning, the discoverer of frequency modulation, uses it.
